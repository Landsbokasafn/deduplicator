** DeDuplicator for Heritrix 3 source now on GitHub - 29/05/2012
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The code for the Heritrix 3 Deduplicator can now be found on {{{https://github.com/kris-sigur/deduplicator}GitHub}}.
 
 No further development will be made on the version for Heritrix 1, but the source code for it and an older revision
 of the one for H3 can still be found in the CVS on SourceForge. 
 
 Version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20120529 is now available {{{release3.html}here}}. Updated for Heritrix 3.1. 


** DeDuplicator for Heritrix 3 - 23/07/2010
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-20100727 is now available {{{release3.html}here}}. 

 This version is compiled against Heritrix 3.0.0. 

 It also updates to use Lucene 3.0.2 (from 2.0.0). Please note that changes in
 the Lucene library mean that memory usage will be approximately 40% greater than
 before. Memory usage appears to be approximately 5 bytes per URL in index, as 
 compared to 3.6 bytes per URL previously. Query times have however improved 
 significantly and are now fixed time without regard for the index size. For
 large indexes this can mean as much as 10-30 times shorter query times. Building
 indexes is also much faster (approximately 3-4 times as fast).

 Currently the DeDupFetchHTTP processor has not been converted. 

 This release heralds the end of the existing DeDuplicator, built against Heritrix 1.14. 
 One final release (1.0.0) will be released soon with some accumulated bugfixes. A release
 candidate is available {{{release.html}here}}.


** Version 0.4.0 released / Future plans - 15/07/2008
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Version 0.4.0 includes numerous tweaks and patches introduced since 0.2.0.
 
 Notable changes:
 
      * Support for changed crawl.log format that Heritrix introduced in 1.12.0.
      
      * Improved memory usage for large indexes.
      
      * Can now exclude duplicate URIs from new index.
      
      * Various bug fixes.  

 This will be the last version of the DeDuplicator that is built against 
 Heritrix 1.10.0. Building against that version of Heritrix has made the
 DeDuplicator compatible with almost all 1.x versions of Heritrix. Note though
 that 0.4.0 is built with Java 1.5, unlike 0.2.0 which was built with Java 
 1.4.2.
 
 In version 1.12.0 Heritrix added some useful features that the DeDuplicator 
 should make use of, most notably marking content as 'not novel' 
 (i.e. duplicate). Also in 1.14.0 there is rudimentary WARC support and the
 aim is to have the DeDuplicator support writing to WARC files. Therefor, any
 future versions will be built against Heritrix 1.14.0.  
 
 Support for Heritrix 2.0 is planned but there is no set timeframe for it.
 This requires considerable changes to the DeDuplicator and will likely not
 be implemented until Heritrix 2.x is sufficiently mature that it is used  
 routinely instead of 1.x for large scale production crawls.
 

** Support for Heritrix 1.12.0 - 1/06/2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 A new interim release has been uploaded to deal with the changed crawl.log format
 in Heritrix 1.12.0. 0.4.0 will be the final release for Heritrix up to version 
 1.12.0 and should be released soon. 
 
 Heritrix version 2.0.0, currently in development, will greatly change Heritrix's
 API and so will require significant changes to the DeDuplicator. Look for 
 the first interim release built against the new Heritrix API as soon as the 
 changes are moved into the trunk of the Heritrix project. Probably sometime
 this month.


** Moved to Sourceforge.net - 7/11/2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 The project has now been moved to Sourceforge.net. The code has been moved
 to SF's CVS and anonymous access is now possible. Initial commit was of version 
 0.2.0.
 Change history prior to 0.2.0 will be discarded except that we will keep the
 packaged PreRelease versions that were made.
 
 Along with the public CVS, SourceForge also provides 
 {{{http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=181565}bug and RFE trackers}}.
 The project website has also been moved to 
 {{http://deduplicator.sourceforge.net/}}.
 
 Stable releases will now be distributed via SourceForge while iterim builds
 will continue to be made available on the {{{release.html}Release History}}
 page (until continous integration is set up).

** Managing duplicates across sequential crawls - 31/10/2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 On September 21, Kristinn Sigurï¿½sson presented a paper on the 
 DeDuplicator titled 'Managing duplicates across sequential crawls' at the 
 {{{http://iwaw.net/06}6th International Web Archiving Workshop}} held in 
 conjunction with the {{{http://ecdl2006.org}10th ECDL}} in Alicante, Spain.
 
 The paper is available in the 
 {{{http://www.iwaw.net/06/PDF/iwaw06-proceedings.pdf}Workshop Procedings}} 
 and can also be downloaded by itself directly from here:
