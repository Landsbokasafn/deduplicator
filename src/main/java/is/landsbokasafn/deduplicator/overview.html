		<h1>DeDuplicator Overview.</h1>
		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<h3>Building an index</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>A functional installation of Heritrix is required for this 
		software to work. While Heritrix can be deployed on non-Linux
		operating systems that requires some degree of work as the bundled 
		scripts are written for Linux. The same applies to this software and 
		the following instructions assume that Heritrix is installed on a 
		Linux machine under $HERITRIX_HOME.</li> 
		<li>Install the DeDuplicator software. The jar files should be 
		included in $HERITRIX_HOME/lib/ while the dedupdigest script
		should be added to $HERITRIX_HOME/bin/. If you've downloaded a .tar.gz
		bundle, explode it into $HERITRIX_HOME and all the files will be 
		correctly deployed. <em>NOTE:</em> Heritrix can not be running 
		at the same time as the DeDuplicator software is run.</li>
		<li>Make the dedupdigest script executable with <code>chmod u+x 
		$HERITRIX_HOME/bin/dedupdigest</code></li>
		<li>Run <code>$HERITRIX_HOME/bin/dedupdigest --help</code> This will
		display the usage information for the indexing.<br>
		The program takes two arguments, the source data (crawl.log usually) 
		and the target directory where the index will be written (will be 
		created if not present). Several options are provided to custom
		tailor the type of index.</li>
		<li>Create an index. A typical index can be built with<br>
		<code>$HERITRIX_HOME/bin/dedupdigest -o URL -s -t &lt;location of 
		crawl.log&gt; &lt;index output directory&gt;</code><br>
		This will create an index that is indexed by URL only (not by the 
		content digest) and includes equivalent URLs and timestamps.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Using the index</h3>
		<ol>
		<li>Having built an appropriate index, launch Heritrix. Make sure that 
		the installation of Heritrix that you launched has the two JARs that
		come with the DeDuplicator (deduplicator-[version].jar and 
		lucene-[version].jar) if it is not the same one used for creating the
		index.</li>
		<li>Configure a crawl job as normal except add the DeDuplicator
		processor to the processing chain at some point <em>after</em> the
		HTTPFetcher processor and prior to any processor which should be 
		skipped if a duplicate is detected.
		When the DeDuplicator finds a duplicate the processing moves 
		straight to the PostProcessing chain. So if you insert it at the top
		of the Extractor chain you can skip both link extraction and writing
		to disk. If you do not wish to skip link extraction you can insert the
		processor at the end of the link extraction chain etc.</li>		
		<li>The DeDuplicator processor has several configurable parameters.
		<ol>
			<li><em>enabled</em> Standard Heritrix property for processors. 
			Should be true. Setting it to false will disable the processor.</li>		
			<li><em>index-location</em> The most important setting. A full path
			to the directory that contains the index (output directory of the 
			indexing.)</li>		
			<li><em>matching-method</em> Whether to lookup URLs or content
			digests first when looking for matches. This setting depends on
			how the index was built (indexing mode). If it was set to BOTH then
			either setting will work. Otherwise it must be set according to the
			indexing mode.</li>		
			<li><em>try-equivalent</em> Should equivalent URLs be tried if an
			exact URL and content digest match is not found. Using equivalent
			matches means that duplicate documents whose URLs differ only in the
			parameter list or because of www[0-9]* prefixes are detected.</li>		
			<li><em>mime-filter</em> Which documents to process</li>		
			<li><em>filter-mode</em></li>		
			<li><em>analysis-mode</em> Enables analysis of the usefulness and
			accuracy of header information in predicting change and non-change
			in documents. For statistical gathering purposes only.</li>		
			<li><em>log-level</em> Enables more logging.</li>		
			<li><em>stats-per-host</em> Maintains statistics per host in 
			addition to the crawl wide stats.</li>		
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Once the processor has been configured the crawl can be started
		and run normally. Information about the processor is available via
		the Processor report in the Heritrix GUI (this is saved to 
		processors-report.txt at the end of a crawl).<br>
		Duplicate URLs will still show up in the crawl log but with a note 
		'duplicate' in the annotation field at the end of the log line.</li>
		</ol>
